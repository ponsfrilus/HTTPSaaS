_Note: this is the first draft of this tool, there is a lot to improve!_

This can be run locally with `npm start` or you can chek it out here: https://httpsaas.herokuapp.com/

Usage: if you want to test a [418](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper_Text_Coffee_Pot_Control_Protocol) HTTP status, open you app to `/418`, e.g. https://httpsaas.herokuapp.com/418.
